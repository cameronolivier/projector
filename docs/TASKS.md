# Open Tasks

Summary
- Some nested folders are being reported as standalone projects. We need to stop descending once a `package.json` is found and treat that directory as the project root. In other words, for discovery purposes, any directory containing a `package.json` is a project root, and scanning should not continue deeper within it.

## Discovery & Scanning
- [x] 0011: Stop descending into nested folders once a `package.json` is found; treat that directory as a project root and do not scan deeper (fix nested subfolder false positives) ([plan](./0011-stop-descending-into-nested-folders-package-json-as-root-plan.md))
- [x] 0012: Comprehensive project root detection and monorepo awareness â€” manifests, lockfiles, VCS boundaries, scoring, and docs-first projects ([plan](./0012-comprehensive-project-root-detection-and-monorepo-awareness-plan.md))
